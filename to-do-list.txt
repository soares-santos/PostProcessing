TEST SEASON: 89

***4/28/17
try forcephoto with writeDB off
see how long it takes, how many cands, etc.

***5/3/17
-run forcephoto 3 times: writeDB off, on, on
-make corrections necessary corresponding to contents of .ini file
-test truthtable step
-make deshostmatch_v2 into a function that can be called as a module in postproc.py hostmatch function

***5/5/17
-add code to create one mega fits file for all candidates
-add timing information to log file
-plots
	-efficiency
	-pull
	-# of candidates per ccd
	-RA/DEC map
	-SNR (fakes)
-incorporate creation of master list into postprocessing
	

1) try running the current version
2) fix the setup file 
3) fix the path for in and out files
4) work on each postproc step and fix/automate them
5) construct a module for each postproc step (listed below) for use in a much shorter and cleaner version of postproc.py
   -set up environment - DONE
   -RUNMON check (with plots?; maybe not as module, maybe don't check RUNMON at all)
   -forcePhoto
   -HostMatch
   -MakeTruthTable
	-Marcelle has code that creates one megafits file
   -MakeDataFiles
	a) real
	b) fake
   -Make plots (other)
   -Make webpage
6) Create code in run_postproc.py that queries to get all expnums in a season if no explist is provided (do this right before making a truth table)

--figure out how to resubmit only specific CCDs that failed (with connection to DB error) OR make code more robust against this error

laterish) within step 1, make table of exposure, ccd, failures

later) on/off switches for each step
later) make it actually work with the ups options and config from Dillon's code
