TEST SEASON: 89

1) try running the current version
2) fix the setup file 
3) fix the path for in and out files
4) work on each postproc step and fix/automate them
5) construct a module for each postproc step (listed below) for use in a much shorter and cleaner version of postproc.py
   -set up environment - DONE
   -RUNMON check (with plots?; maybe not as module, maybe don't check RUNMON at all)
   -forcePhoto
   -HostMatch
   -MakeTruthTable
   -MakeDataFiles
	a) real
	b) fake
   -Make plots (other)
   -Make webpage
6) Create code in run_postproc.py that queries to get all expnums in a season if no explist is provided (do this right before making a truth table)

laterish) within step 1, make table of exposure, ccd, failures

later) on/off switches for each step
later) make it actually work with the ups options and config from Dillon's code
